# Nand-to-Tetris
In Nand to tetris course(of the Hebrew University) we will build a 16 bit computer from basic logical gates until we have a running compiler and OS to run the our computer, 
(OS and compiler will work on Jack language for more information checkout the book: The Elements of Computing Systems, By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 
Each project will handle a diffarent element in our computer as I"ll elaborate for each project. 

Project_1:
  we build our logical gates (not, or, xor etc.) using only the elemntry gate Nand. 

Project_2:
  add more components to the computer we are building, mainly the ALU component needed for caculations in CPU, hence for the ALU we need adder etc.

Project_3:
  added memory components:
      a. basic components of memory such as bit, registers etc.
      b. larger memory components such as RAM16k, big enough to handle prpoper execution for the computer we are building

Project_4: 
  algorithms and implementation of the oparations: sort, devide, multiplay and fill

Project_5:


Project_6:
  build an assembler !!

Project 7,8:
  full vm translator takes code writen in vm languege and translates
  it to hack assembly languege. first part translates arithmetic and push 
  and pop commands
  
 Ptoject_9_10:
   first part of jack compiler, gets jack files and outputs xml files.
   xml files are mid leval step of full compilation for machine language
   
project_11:
  second part of jack compiling, handles back to back compiling meening prog
  gets jack files and fully transaltes them into vm code and from vm
  to machine languege we all ready handelsd in prev projects

Project_12:
  Full OS for the computer we built in the all projects. this OS can handle basic 
  computer components such as drowing and placing and editing text, basic math calculations.
