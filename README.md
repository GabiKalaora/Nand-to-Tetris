# Nand-to-Tetris
In Nand to tetris course(of the Hebrew University) we will build a 16 bit computer from basic logical gates until we have a running compiler and OS to run the our computer, 
(OS and compiler will work on Jack language for more information checkout the book: The Elements of Computing Systems, By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 
Each project will handle a diffarent element in our computer as I"ll elaborate for each project. 

Project_1:
  we build our logical gates (not, or, xor etc.) using only the elemntry gate Nand. 

Project_2:
  add more components to the computer we are building, mainly the ALU component needed for caculations in CPU, hence for the ALU we need adder etc.

Projrct_3:
  added memory components:
      a. basic components of memory such as bit, registers etc.
      b. larger memory components such as RAM16k, big enough to handle prpoper execution for the computer we are building
