# Nand-to-Tetris
In Nand to tetris course(of the Hebrew University) we will build a computer from basic logical gates until we have a running compiler and OS to run the our computer, 
(OS and compiler will work on Jack language for more information checkout the book: The Elements of Computing Systems, By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 
Each project will handle a diffarent element in our computer as I"ll elaborate for each project. 

Project_1:
  we build our logical gates (not, or, xor etc.) using only the elemntry gate Nand.
